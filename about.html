    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>I'm Carsten Könemann. I'm originally from Bielefeld, Germany.</p>
    <p>I've received a diploma's degree in computer science from <a href="http://www.uni-bremen.de">Universität Bremen</a>, Germany. I work as an iOS Developer in Bremen, Germany. You can find some of the code i write in my personal time on <a href="https://github.com/cargath">GitHub</a>. When i talk about development you can find my slides on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/cargath"> Speaker Deck</a>.</p>
    <p>My non-development interests include various kinds of sports (gym, bouldering, running, cycling), playing guitar (rock, blues) and (mostly Marvel) comics.</p>
